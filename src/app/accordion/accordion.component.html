            The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that
            are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It will say on
            each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to
            tell the difference.

            Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your
            portfolio. Helping developers add professional-looking projects to
            their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!

            The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
            Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so
            it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help"
            channel!
